1. Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
Challenge: In file-based systems, the same data might be stored in multiple locations, leading to redundancy and inconsistencies when the data is updated in one place but not in another.
Solution by DBMS: DBMS centralizes data storage, ensuring that data is stored only once and accessed by multiple applications. This eliminates redundancy and maintains data consistency.

2. Data Isolation
Challenge: In traditional file systems, data is scattered across different files and formats, making it difficult to access and retrieve related data efficiently.
Solution by DBMS: DBMS organizes data into tables and relationships, allowing for easier data integration and retrieval through structured queries.

3. Difficulty in Accessing Data:
Challenge: Retrieving specific data from file-based systems often requires custom programs, making data access complex and time-consuming.
Solution by DBMS: DBMS provides powerful query languages (like SQL) that allow users to easily retrieve, update, and manipulate data without needing extensive programming knowledge.

4.Data Security:
Challenge: File-based systems often lack proper security measures, making sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access and breaches.
Solution by DBMS: DBMS offers robust security features, including user authentication, access control, and encryption, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data.

5.Data Integrity:
Challenge: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across a system was difficult with file-based storage, as there were no mechanisms to enforce data integrity rules.
Solution by DBMS: DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints (like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints) and transactions, ensuring that the data adheres to predefined rules and remains consistent.
