A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.

Consider an online bookstore. A database can manage:

Books: Details like titles, authors, prices, and stock levels.
Customers: Information such as names, addresses, and purchase history.
Orders: Records of which customers bought which books, the purchase date, and payment details.
Why We Need a Database:

Efficient Data Management: Quickly retrieve and update information. For example, check book stock status instantly.
Data Integrity: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data, such as preventing duplicate book prices.
Scalability: Handles large volumes of data and grows with your business, managing more books and customers efficiently.
Security: Protects data through access controls and encryption, keeping sensitive information safe.
Data Relationships: Links related data, such as connecting customer orders to specific books and transaction dates.
